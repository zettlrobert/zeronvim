# ZRVIM Configuration

This is a project, to provide myself with a working, portable nvim configuration.
It should support core features and easily configurable.

It will also contain some useful documentation, to remember already looked at concepts, this will also always refer to the original source.

The entire configuration should/will be written with `lua`

## Development Procedure
For development purposed this directory is located in a `development` location and will be invoked via `zrvim`.
For now I will accomplish this by setting up an alias for `nvim -u /path/to/configuration` 

## Documentation
- [zerovim and lua](./docs/zerovim-and-lua.md)

## Plugins
Here all installed plugins with a short description will be listed.

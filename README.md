# ZRVIM Configuration

This is a project, to provide myself with a working, portable nvim configuration.
It should support core features and easily configurable.

It will also contain some useful documentation, to remember already looked at concepts, this will also always refer to the original source.

The entire configuration should/will be written with `lua`

## Development Procedure

For development purposed we will setup a docker container and mount this configuration in `$HOME/.config/nvim` the correct location.
This directory is located in a `development` location and will be invoked via `zrvim`.

## Documentation
